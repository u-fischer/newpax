#newpax â€” A package to reinsert links in PDF included as graphics

This package allows to insert PDF in a document while preserving
internal and external links. With lualatex it works in the document
directly, other engines require to run a compilation with lualatex or to call
a lua script first.

The package is based on and uses code from [pax](https://ctan.org/pkg/pax) by Heiko Oberdiek.
