The package is based on the [pax package](https://ctan.org/pkg/pax) by Heiko Oberdiek. 
If offers a lua-based alternative to the java based `pax.jar` to extract the annotations from a PDF. The resulting file
 can then be used together with `pax.sty`. It also offers an extended style which works with all three major engines.
 
## Requirements 

The style requires the new LaTeX PDF management code from the pdfmanagement-testphase package and so also
a current LaTeX and a current L3 layer.

##  Structure

- `newpax.lua` and `newpax.sty` are located in the main folder.
- The doc folder contains the documentation.
- `testfiles` contains tests for the l3build system.
